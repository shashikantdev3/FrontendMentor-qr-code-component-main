## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

This is my third Challenge though I should take it as my First Challenge as this is very simple but very good practice for those who just learned HTML CSS concepts like accesibility, Grid, Flex, Media Query. I have already learned these concepts in my past two Challenges which are [First Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-product-preview-card-component-using-css-grid-and-flexbox-gZz2gLwuMi), [Second Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/results-summary-component-main-using-css-grid-and-flex-dW-BwF65IV)
